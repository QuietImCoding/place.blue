### Bot detection

A few major things seem to give away many bots on bluesky atm

- Engagement maximizing
    - Check min/median/mean follower count of reply targets
- Written tone
    - Check average post length / word usage distribution
- Reply-oriented behavior
    - Check percentage of posts that are replies / reposts / original posts

you probably could create a "humanity index" that uses metrics about their average post length, word usage, reply-post-repost ratio, and follower count of a person's replies to get a pretty good idea of bot or not (at least as they behave rn)
